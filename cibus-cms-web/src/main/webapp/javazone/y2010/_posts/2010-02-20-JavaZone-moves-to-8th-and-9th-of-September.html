title: JavaZone moves to 8th and 9th of September
---

<p>Due to the proximity with other international conferences, JavaZone will be moved one week earlier than previously announced. The new dates are 8th and 9th of September.</p>

<p>We hope that by doing this we will be more attractive to the speakers and participants who wish to attend both conferences.</p>

<p>The JavaZone Committee hopes people understand this change, which we think is the best decision for all parties.</p>

<p>Welcome to JavaZone in Oslo Spektrum the 8th and 9th of September!</p>
