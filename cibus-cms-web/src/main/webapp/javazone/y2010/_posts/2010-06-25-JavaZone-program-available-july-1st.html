<p>
    After a lot of hard work in the JavaZone Program Committee, we are happy to announce that we will start to distribute feedback to everyone who have submitted abstracts for this year's conference in a couple of days.
</p>
<p>
    Shortly after the speakers have received their feedback, we will start to confirm them officially. The conference schedule will then be published gradually.
<p>
</p>
    Our agenda application will be available to July 1st and we will add speakers and presentations to the schedule on as soon as the speakers confirm that they will appear at the conference.<br/>
Enjoy!
