The Agenda for JavaZone 2010 is now available at <a href="http://jz10.java.no/agenda">http://jz10.java.no/agenda</a>.
</p>
<p>
Please note that this is not the complete program for the conference. We are
still working on distributing feedback to everyone who have contributed with
abstracts for the conference. This means that the process of publishing
confirmed presentations and lightning talks is an ongoing process. Expect more
time-slots to be filled during the next couple of days.
