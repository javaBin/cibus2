    <p>On these pages you will find information about everything to do with JavaZone. There are answers to everything:
        what JavaZone is, how to book a hotel room, meeting places and events during the conference, how to get to know
        other attendees, and how you can make a contribution as part of the crew. You can also read previous years'
        websites and get an idea of the JavaZone atmosphere. JavaZone is more than just a conference. It's a place to
        meet, network and socialise!</p>

    <h2>What is JavaZone</h2>

    <p>JavaZone is Scandinavia's biggest meeting place for software developers, and one of Europe's most important.
        JavaZone has been described as a high-quality, independent conference, and is a forum for knowledge exchange,
        recruitment and branding. Some 40 large and mid-sized businesses - our partners - exhibit their products and
        services in a separate exhibition space, while more than 90 presentations are given in the conference
        facilities. Each year, around 2,300 conference tickets are sold. This means that, over the two days the
        conference lasts, we deliver more than 200,000 hours of expertise. When you add to this the many informal
        discussions that take place at stands and between attendees, JavaZone stands out as a tremendous arena for
        knowledge transfer. Of course, a conference involving so many developers is also a key arena for recruitment.
        Through their exhibitions and other activities, the large and mid-sized companies use the opportunity to promote
        their business and recruit new staff.</p>

    <p>One of the key factors in the huge success of JavaZone has been the support of great numbers of volunteers. It is
        safe to say that this is a conference by and for software developers. Each year, thousands of hours are put into
        making the conference as successful as possible. The technical programme is carefully structured and planned and
        the programme committee invites speakers from all over the world. Professionals know what professionals want, so
        the speakers are hand-picked, and the presentations are highly relevant. In the tradition of the conference,
        speakers are not paid an appearance fee for their contributions. Around half of the presentations are given in
        English and the other half in one of the Scandinavian languages. The conference's unconventional and
        non-commercial approach has also boosted its popularity. </p>
