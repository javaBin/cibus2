    <p>It's a cold, white, winter day in Norway. On a Saturday morning at 09.00am, while the rest of the population is
        out skiing, we find the JZ Crew creating their own dream - JavaZone 2010! The place is Soria Moria Conference
        Center and we can feel the tension. The atmosphere is strangely calm, but there seem to be going on a lot in the
        parallel sessions.</p>

    <p>"We try to work as much as possible when we meet - and talk less, says Andreas" He's just found a good name for a
        new concept this year: <a href="http://jz10.java.no/journey.html">JZ JourneyZone</a>.</p>

    <p><i>Today</i></p>

    <p>Outside we found two strange beings, with typical norwegian beanies, in their own creative session blogging about
        the conference.</p>
