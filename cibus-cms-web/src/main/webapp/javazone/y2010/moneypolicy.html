<h1>JavaZone Monetary Policy</h1>
<div id="body">
    <p>The organiser of JavaZone is javaBin (the Norwegian Java User Group), an independent, non-profit organization.
        Its objective is to promote java expertise among its members, their companies and in the market. javaBin is
        based in Oslo, with local groups in SÃ¸rlandet, Stavanger, Bergen and Trondheim. The organisation of JavaZone is
        based on voluntary work. We believe that this makes our conference unique.</p>

    <p>JavaZone does not offer any classical sponsorships although we do have a partner program. However, the work which
        is done by the Program Committee in order to create the best possible agenda is completely independent. No one
        (including partners) can influence the outcome of the agenda for the conference. As a result of our
        independence, we have very limited resources when it comes to covering costs for our speakers. In the case of
        the conference ending in positive figures, we assure you that the money will be pushed back to the Java
        community.</p>

    <p>For this reason, we have a general policy on not reimbursing speakers. It is our impression that most speakers
        are backed by a company which in most cases will cover costs for traveling and accommodation. However, there are
        exceptional cases where we cover traveling and accommodation costs, or even parts of these for some
        speakers.</p>

    <p>As of JavaZone 2010 we wish to be 100% open around our monetary policy. Also we want to be sure that all speakers
        receive the same information.</p>

    <p>Speakers can apply for refund on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Accommodation</li>
        <li>Traveling costs</li>
    </ul>

    <br/>

    <p>Please note that under no circumstances do we pay anyone to speak at the conference.</p>

    <p>Reimbursements are based on the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All costs must be approved by e-mail from javazone@java.no.</li>

        <li>Refunds are made after the conference, given the approval. We don't have the capacity to refund up-front.
        </li>
        <li>Cheaper is better :)</li>
        <li>Our goal is that all refunds are completed within two weeks after the conference, given that we have
            received the proper details.
        </li>
    </ul>
