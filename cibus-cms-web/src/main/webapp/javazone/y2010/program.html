    <p><strong>*** The CFP is extended to April 9th ***</strong></p>

    <p>We would like to inform you that the call for papers for JavaZone 2010 will open January 22nd.</p>

    <p>To take place in Oslo, Norway, on September 8th-9th 2010, the conference will offer a combination of technical
        talks and panels in an informal atmosphere with an expected attendence of 2000. JavaZone 2010 will be the ninth
        consecutive JavaZone conference.</p>

    <p>As previous years, last year's conference was a massive success, with software professionals and partners
        enjoying more than 100 sessions covering multiple topics, and an impressive lineup of internationally known
        speakers. Leading evangelists in the community rate JavaZone as one of most important Java events in Europe.</p>

    <p>The JavaZone conference is organized by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group (JUG). javaBin is an idealistic,
        non-profit organization established in 1996 by a group of Java enthusiasts. The JUG has since evolved to be the
        leading group for the promotion of Java in Scandinavia.</p>

    <h2>Journey of the Norwegian mountain wilds</h2>

    <p>This year we will arrange a journey for speakers to explore norwegian nature.</p>

    <p>The Journey of the Norwegian Wilds is the very first collective post-activity in the JavaZone history. Every year
        we know of a few speakers both from Norway and abroad meet to enjoy Norway's wild nature after the conference.
        This year we would like to invite all speakers and members of the JavaZone Committee to explore the wild nature,
        enjoy the very best of Norwegian food and have a great time together in the weekend following the
        conference.</p>

    <p>More information and registration information can be found on the <a href="journey.html">journey page</a>.</p>

    <h2>Monetary Policy</h2>

    <p>The organiser of JavaZone is javaBin (the Norwegian Java User Group), an independent, non-profit organization.
        The conference has partners but no sponsors. The agenda is defined by the Program Committee without external
        interference. This independence is among the things that make JavaZone unique. We therefore have a limited
        budget for reimbursing conference speakers. Please see <a href="moneypolicy.html">here</a> for more information.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact information</h2>

    <p>Please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:program@java.no">program@java.no</a> should you need any
        further information.</p>

    <p>Hope to see you there, and feel free to spread the word about JavaZone 2010 in your local community.</p>

    <p>Best Regards,</p>

    <p>The JavaZone Program Committee</p>
